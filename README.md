I recently attended a two-day workshop focused on Business Intelligence using Power BI, where I had an enriching experience learning the intricacies of data visualization and dashboard creation. The sessions were engaging, and I found myself deeply involved in the learning process.

During the workshop, I had the opportunity to create the SN Corp Dashboard using Power BI. This dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) for the organization. I utilized a variety of visualizations, including maps, pie charts, line graphs, bar charts, and slicers, to ensure that the data is presented in an easily digestible and interactive manner.

One of the highlights of the dashboard is its interactivity. Users can filter the data based on specific criteria such as order date and shipping mode, making it a powerful tool for real-time data analysis and decision-making.
